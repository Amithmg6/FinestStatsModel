# Count
Count is to *determine the total number of* (a collection of items). Though count has a broader meaning. I will stick to stats only!!

In statistics, count data is a statistical data type, a type of data in which the observations can take only the *non-negative integer values* {0, 1, 2, 3, ... }, and where these integers arise from counting rather than ranking.

This section deals with the various approaches to count the data stored in different forms using R.
